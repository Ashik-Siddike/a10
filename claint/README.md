Project Theme

A crowdfunding website is a platform where people can raise money for different projects, ideas, or causes by inviting others to contribute financially. These projects can include personal needs (like medical expenses), creative ideas (like making a film or app), and startups (like launching a new product). 

Key Rules: 
GitHub Commits: 
Include a minimum of 15 notable GitHub commits on the client side.
Include a minimum of 8 notable GitHub commits on the server side 
Readme.md: Add a meaningful readme.md file with the name of your website and a live site URL. Include a minimum of five bullet points to feature your website.  
Responsiveness: Make it responsive for all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views. 
Environment Variables: The Environment variable hides the Firebase config keys and Mongodb credentials.
Lorem Text: Don't use any Lorem ipsum text; you can not use the default alert to show any error or success message. 
Unique Design: Create a unique Design but remember, your website idea shouldn't be similar to any projects you've done before or to any examples in our modules or conceptual sessions.
You can also look for free resources on blogs to help with your website.
Host your Application:  You can choose deployment systems like Netlify, Surge, and Firebase for client-side hosting and vercel for server-side hosting. As you develop a single-page application 
Ensure the page doesn't throw any error when reloading from any routes.  
Add your domain for authorization to Firebase if you use Netlify / surge
Logged in User must not  redirect to Login on reloading any private route

These campaigns are still active, and people can contribute to them. Here you will show the data from the database. Which data you want to show on the card is up to you. Each card will contain a "See More" button.

Email 
Password 
Google login, GitHub - implement any of one 
A link that will redirect to the Register page 
🎯Here the email and password should match with the registered email and password. If it doesn't match, show an error. You can show an error by using toast/sweet alert if you want. 
Register Page: You have to use a password and email-based authentication to register. The Register page will have the following -

      ## MongoDB Atlas Setup

  - The backend uses MongoDB Atlas for all data storage.
  - Credentials are stored in environment variables (`.env`).
  - All campaign and donation data is stored and retrieved from Atlas.
  - The Home page uses MongoDB's limit operator to show 6 running campaigns.
  
My  Campaign (/myCampaign) 
It will be a private/protected route. On this page, a user can see all the Campaigns he/she has added to the database. here a user can only see his/her added data, but he/she can not access other's data. Here you need to show the data in table Format. Each row of the table will contain these information- 	
3-4 information about the campaign
"Update" Button 
"Delete" Button
Update Campaign Page (/updateCampaign/:id)  
It will be a private/protected route. When a user clicks on the "Update Button" it will take the user to the Update page, where there will be a form for the user to update a Campaign. The form will have the following: 
All the fields you have taken in the Add New Campaign Page (But user name & user email will be read-only) 
"Update" button

	This will be a private/protected route. When you fill in the data and submit the "Update" button, these data will be updated to the previous data in your database and you will show a success message through toast/sweet alert. 

🎯🎯(Optional): If you don't want to create an Update page, you can also use a modal to update your data. For this when you click on the "Update" button it will open a modal but make sure you are logged in before updating the data.

Delete: 
 If the user clicks the delete button, the Campaigns will be removed from the data. Before the delete, ask for a delete confirmation.

It will be a private/protected route. On this page, a user can see all the Donated Campaigns he/she has added to the database. You need to show all the data in Card format. here a user can only see his/her added data, but he/she can not access other's data. Which data you want to show is your choice.
